      "text": "December begins with a sense of anticipation. As we enter the season of Advent, our hearts often feel the tension between the 'now' and the 'not yet.' Psalm 130:5 describes a deep, soul-level waiting. It’s not a passive boredom, but an active **hope**. As a woman, you may be waiting for a breakthrough, a healing, or a restored relationship. Let this season remind you that waiting on God is never wasted time. Anchor your soul in His Word today. He is coming, and He is faithful.",

It’s easy to confuse busy-ness with effectiveness. But a woman’s true spiritual power comes from a quiet trust in God, not a frantic schedule. Can you carve out ten minutes of silence today? Turn off the music, put down the phone, and just be. In that quietness, you will find the strength to face the noise.",

You don't have to dread the coming year. You don't have to worry about the 'what ifs.' You can face the future with a smile, secure in the knowledge that your God is already there. Clothe yourself in His strength today.",
